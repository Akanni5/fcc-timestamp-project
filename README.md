# fcc-timestamp-project
My solution to fcc-timestamp-project

Hi

I just completed [@freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) [backend development and APIs](https://www.freecodecamp.org//learn/back-end-development-and-apis) course.
This is 1 of 5 projects.

You can check the project out by simply cloning and using `npm install` to install its dependencies. After that you can execute `npm run start` to run the project.
Hope you'll find this repo useful. If, you're reading this please throw a star at me.


The API can be access via the `[project_url]/api/<valid date>`. And there's also an input where you can simply send `<valid date>` to. It will help request the data and redirect you
to the API portal.
